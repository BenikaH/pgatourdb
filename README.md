# PGA Tour Database

This database is a mock-up database for school that I worked on. It contains real data courtesy of http://www.pgatour.com/data/repo/. In order to design, I took the data from the PGA Tour's repository and transformed it into several thousand insert statements that could be inserted into my database. The majority of the data I was looking for was stored in json objects. Consequently, I wrote several python scripts to parse them and push the data into insert statements.
